%Mention SoC?

%TODO: add risc or cisc / software pipelining / DSP,Microcontroller or microprocessor / other comp arch?


%Talk a bit about different computer architectures (include software pipelining) and that each of these architectures have different charactaristics and that to see if an architecture is efficient, we need a compiler when designing such architecture to see if it is actually efficient. Introduce llvm then go to next section

%TODO: add computer architecture intro and the need for a wide variety of compilers.
%TODO: add introducing text to answer the question, why do we use LLVM

% move? architecture/compiler down after first couple of chapters
