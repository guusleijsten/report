%Old abstract
%In this report, we will research in ways to reduce energy consumption. We will achieve this by reducing the total amount of accesses to the register file by means of exploiting explicit datapaths. We describe six different approaches and evaluate which is most suitable based on tradeoffs, i.e. implementation complexity, compile time, quality of resulting code, etc. We have already implemented one approach. However, to improve it, and to handle vector instructions, we need to extend this work significantly. The real work begins only now.
