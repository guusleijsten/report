This report concludes the preparation phase of the master project and will be used as a starting point for our master thesis. We tackle multiple approaches to generate efficient code for an SIMD architecture with explicit datapaths. We will develop each of these approaches within the LLVM compiler framework, as a means to extend a compiler to handle exposed datapaths. From six approaches that we propose in this report, we already implemented the first one. However, to improve it, and to handle vector instructions, we need to extend this work significantly. To conclude, the preparation phase is to get into the subject, and to get familiar with the project. The real work begins only now.
