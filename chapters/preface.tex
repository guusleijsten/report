Before starting, I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude. I would like to thank all the people that are close to me for their continuous support and motivation to study electronic and computer systems.

%Please write all your preface text here. If you do so, don't forget to thank your supervisor, other committee members, your family, colleagues etc.\ etc. 
I want to thank my mom who is a very head strong person and my brother who both helped me in many ways. I would also like to thank professor dr. Henk Corporaal, who intrigued me to study computer architectures and my supervisor from Radbound university in Nijmegen, Roel Jordans who guided me and introduced me in the field of compilers.

Also, many thanks go to Luc Waeijen who helpt me in technical details and whom helped me to further develop my programming skills.

I would also like to thank Liu Zhenyuan for his initial implementation of the compiler, and Boyan Liang for his view on the hardware side of this project.

Finally, I would like to conclude the thanks with a quote, ``Tell me and I forget, Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.'' - Benjamin Franklin.
