Before starting, I would like to thank all the people that are close to me for their continuous support and motivating me to study electronics and computer systems, and would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude.

%Please write all your preface text here. If you do so, don't forget to thank your supervisor, other committee members, your family, colleagues etc.\ etc. 
I want to thank my mom who is a very head strong person and my brother who both helped me in many ways. I would also like to thank professor dr. Henk Corporaal, who intrigued me to study computer architectures and my supervisor from Radbound university in Nijmegen, Roel Jordans who guided me and introduced me in the field of compilers.

%TODO: move henk first, parents and bro last.
%TODO: thank to Liu, for his initial implementation of compiler

%I would like to end this thanks with a quote, ``Tell me and I forget, Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn." - Benjamin Franklin.

%thanks to electronic systems group, my family and brother that guided and supported me throughout my entire study. blablabla
