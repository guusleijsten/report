Course-grain and fine-grain planning for the graduation phase. The graduation phase will take six months, so we distribute that time span over each of the phases in Table \ref{table:planning}.

\toprule
\textbf{Phase} 		& \textbf{Tasks} & \textbf{Duration} \\ \hline
Benchmarks setup 	& Develop benchmarks described in Chapter \ref{sec:benchmarks}.			& 1 week \\
First phase		& Implement a pass that allocates bypasses last minute, just before instructions are printed, as described in Chapter \ref{sec:last_minute_alloc}.		& 1 week \\
Second phase	& Implement a custom register allocation, that first allocates bypasses and allocates the remaining registers as usual, as described in Chapter \ref{sec:ra_approach}.	& 2 weeks \\
Third phase		& Implement a custom scheduler for our backend, that improves utilization of the bypass network, as described in Chapter \ref{sec:scheduling_approach}. & 3 weeks \\
Fourth phase 	& Implement a pass glueing instructions together that can be bypassed, as described in Chapter \ref{sec:pre_scheduling}. & 3 weeks\\
Fifth phase 	& Extend Unison to make it bypass aware, as described in Chapter \ref{sec:combined_sched_ra}. & 3 weeks \\
Sixth phase		& Implement heuristics that do combined RA and scheduling, as described in Chapter \ref{sec:combined_sched_ra}. & 5 weeks \\
Final report		& Write report and collect benchmark data. 	& 6 weeks \\
