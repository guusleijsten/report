This chapter will aim to cover background knowledge about computer architecture, the LLVM Framework and features of a wide SIMD. After that the related work follows, which discusses other exposed or explicit data path architectures, the legacy compiler and developments on the LLVM-based compiler for our target SIMD architecture.
